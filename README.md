# Hackathon: Detection of AI-Generated Texts

This AI-focused hackathon spanned a 4-day week. Our team of three members was tasked with developing an artificial intelligence project and presenting it to a jury.

We chose to create an AI-generated essay detector, a tool designed to help educators identify if a student used ChatGPT to write their essay.

For this project, we worked with a dataset of 17,000 English essays, some authored by an AI and others by real students. We processed the data using NLP techniques and trained a model. This model was deployed via a Flask application, located in the `app/` folder.

The project is divided into two parts:
1. **Data exploration and AI model training**
2. **Model deployment as a REST API using Flask**

Special thanks to Leo Taverne and Serge Tehe for collaborating on this project.

## üìÅ Content

1. **Data Exploration and AI Model Training**
   - **Data Exploration**  
      - Analyzed class distributions (AI-generated texts vs. human-authored texts).  
      - Studied text lengths to identify potential structural differences.  
   - **Text Preprocessing**  
      - Cleaned the data (removing special characters, lemmatization, and stopword removal).  
      - Created a clean corpus for training and classification.  
   - **Text Representation**  
      - Generated embeddings using FastText, which handles unknown words via n-grams.  
      - Calculated weighted averages of word vectors for each text.  
   - **Supervised Learning Models**  
      - Trained multiple classification models, including:  
         - Logistic Regression  
         - SVM (Support Vector Machine)  
         - Random Forest  
         - HistGradientBoosting  
      - Optimized hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** and stratified cross-validation.  
   - **Evaluation and Inference**  
      - Evaluated performance on test data (ROC-AUC scores, F1, confusion matrices).  
      - Developed an inference function to predict the source of a text using the full pipeline.  

2. **Model Deployment as a REST API using Flask**  
   - The API allows users to submit a text and predict whether it was generated by a language model or written by a human.  
   - **API Structure**:  
      - The application is built on Flask and provides two main endpoints:  
         - `GET /lab/hackathon`: Serves a simple web interface (`index.html`) to test the application.  
         - `POST /lab/hackathon/process`: Accepts input text (via form or JSON) and returns the probability of being AI-generated.  
   - **Main Code**:  
      - The Flask server imports the AI pipeline, applying preprocessing and feature extraction to submitted texts.  
      - Embeddings are generated for each text via FastText, and probabilities are calculated using a pre-trained Random Forest model.  
   - **Key Features**:  
      - Automatic text cleaning and preprocessing (normalization, stopword removal, and lemmatization).  
      - Embedding generation using a custom FastText model.  
      - Real-time text evaluation using the Random Forest model.
